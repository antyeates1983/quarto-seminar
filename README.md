# quarto-seminar

A seminar talk I gave on creating Quarto course materials for undergraduate mathematics courses.

- The talk itself is in `html` format generated with Quarto.
- Templates for lecture notes and problem sheets are in the accompanying folders.

Link to Quarto software: <https://quarto.org/>

The lecture notes template requires the `custom-numbered-blocks` extension:
